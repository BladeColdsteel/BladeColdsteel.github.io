            Royal Rangers is an activity-based, small-group church ministry for boys and young men in grades K-12. We provide a diverse program of fun activities, specifically designed to meet the unique needs and interests of boys. 
            Boys participate in weekly small group meetings and activities under the leadership of adult men and women who are specifically trained to deliver the adventure that is Royal Rangers.
